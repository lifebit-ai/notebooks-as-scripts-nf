The function `ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats` is designed to facilitate 
**data exploration**, and for making highly customizable **publication-ready plots**,
with relevant statistical details included in the plot itself if desired. We
will see examples of how to use this function in this vignette.

To begin with, here are some instances where you would want to use
`ggbetweenstats`-

 - to check if a continuous variable differs across multiple groups/conditions
 - to compare distributions visually and check for outliers

**Note**: This vignette uses the pipe operator (`%>%`), if you are not
familiar with this operator, here is a good explanation:
